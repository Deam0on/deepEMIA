  created: "2025-11-20"
  notes: |
    FIX: Reduce false positives and overlapping detections
    - Higher confidence thresholds
    - Lower IoU thresholds (merge duplicates)
    - Spatial constraints ENABLED
    - Less aggressive iteration

# Custom scale bar ROI for this dataset
scale_bar_roi:
  x_start_factor: 0.5
  y_start_factor: 0.005
  width_factor: 0.8
  height_factor: 0.065

# Adjusted for potential edge-close scale bars
scalebar_thresholds:
  intensity: 100               # Lowered from 100 for dimmer scale bars
  proximity: 100              # Increased from 100 for wider spacing
  merge_gap: 15               # Increased from 15 for more merging
  min_line_length: 30         # Reduced from 30 for shorter scale bars
  edge_margin_factor: 0.1    # Reduced from 0.1 for edge-close bars
